		<h2>Right back to the drawing board.</h2>

		<p>I was asked to help <a href="http://www.align.net.nz" target="_blank">Align</a> redesign their website with a fresh new approach, leading to a fresh new look, while keeping the core of their style and sensibilities.</p>

		<p>Excited by the opportunity to start from scratch, we organised 2 initial workshops to establish how a new website could convey Align's purpose for existing, desired outcomes for its clients and capture the unique flair they bring to each of their projects.</p>

		<p>Once the focus was set, it was time to get into wireframing (a basic design without any colour or styling) in order to get a feel for the content, layout and flow of information. One of the major decisions was to use elements of <a href="https://rustygeorge.com/undesigned-design-so-bad-its-good/" target="_blank">undesign</a> (a seemingly, and somewhat ironically, <span style="font-style:italic;">unaligned</span> and random display of elements on the page) for the new website's style, to reflect the out-of-the-box thinking Align takes with its projects.</p>
