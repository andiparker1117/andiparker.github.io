		<h2>Giving back to those who gave so much for us.</h2>

		<p>I was asked to help <a href="http://www.veteransaffairs.mil.nz" target="_blank">Veterans' Affairs</a> redesign their website with a refined information architecture, new online style guide (borrowing from their print style guide). <strong>Most importantly</strong>, though, I was asked to design an <a href="https://www.veteransaffairs.mil.nz/eligibility/check-your-eligibility/check" target="_blank">eligibility checker</a> for veterans – helping them determine if they were eligible for any financial help from the government.</p>

		<p>Going through various workshops to nail down the requirements for the Checker, we landed on a flow that worked.</p>

		<p>From there, the most pressing item was designing the checker along with the rest of the site using a series of wireframes and UI designs. There was a clear style – fonts and colours – needing to be adhered to, but there was freedom to improve the style and flow of their outdated website.</p>

		<p>Extensive testing was implemented on the Checker throughout Veterans' Affairs and current/ex-military personnel to ensure (a) the design was easy to follow, and (b) the results that came back were helpful.</p>
